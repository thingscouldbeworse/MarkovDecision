# CS463G Fall 2017 Markov Decision

# Running 

All code is contained in `run.py` and invoked with `python run.py [n|inf]` where `n` is a value to run up until the Vn level. Use `inf` instead if you wish to run the program until it finds an optimal infinite-horizon with the gamma value. Use Ctrl-C to exit early. All code was written and run in Python 3.
